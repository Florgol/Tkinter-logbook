# Tkinter Logbook
This is a logbook in which you can view, add, edit and delete entries.
It is a small project that is part of my studies at the BHT (Berliner Hochschule für Technik).
It utilizes Pythons's GUI-Toolkit - Tkinter.

To start the project, download project as zip file. Once unzipped, run 'logbook.py'.
